# The Walkthrough Application

The <sup>1</sup> sample application we will be building is a simple party planner. The user should be able to *enter a list of attendees and their guests*, *keep track of who has confirmed attendance*, *filter attendees by particular criteria*, and quickly *view important statistics regarding the event*. Throughout the creation of the application we will explore the core concepts of @ngrx/store and discuss popular patterns and best practices. 

There are two links provided above each section, *Work Along* and *Completed Lesson*. The *Work Along* link picks up at the beginning of each lesson if you wish to code along as the concepts are presented. Otherwise, the *Completed Lesson* link allows you to start at the end point of the current lesson. 

Without further ado, let's get started!
